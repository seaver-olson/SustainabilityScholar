  - Emphasizes the importance of being sustainable

- **Navigation Links to the Three Main Categories:**
  - **Energy**
    - **Renewable Energy**
      - Solar, wind, and geothermal vs. traditional fossil fuels
      - **Solar Energy**

        - Solar radiation is light – also known as electromagnetic radiation – emitted by the sun.
        - The amount of sunlight that strikes the earth's surface in an hour and a half is enough to handle the entire world's energy consumption for a full year.
        - Solar technologies convert sunlight into electrical energy either through photovoltaic (PV) panels or through mirrors that concentrate solar radiation.
          - This energy can be used to generate electricity or be stored in batteries or thermal storage.
        - **Types of Solar Energy Technologies**
          - **Photovoltaics (PV)**: Used in solar panels; captures energy directly from sunlight and stores it in PV cells.
          - **Concentrating Solar-Thermal Power (CSP)**: Used in large power plants; reflects sunlight with mirrors to create heat, which is then stored for energy.
