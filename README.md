  - Introduces the three categories
  - Emphasizes the importance of being sustainable

- **Navigation Links to the Three Main Categories:**
  - **Energy**
    - **Renewable Energy**
      - Solar, wind, and geothermal vs. traditional fossil fuels
      - **Solar Energy**

        - Solar radiation is light – also known as electromagnetic radiation – emitted by the sun.
        - The amount of sunlight that strikes the earth's surface in an hour and a half is enough to handle the entire world's energy consumption for a full year.
        - Solar technologies convert sunlight into electrical energy either through photovoltaic (PV) panels or through mirrors that concentrate solar radiation.
          - This energy can be used to generate electricity or be stored in batteries or thermal storage.
        - **Types of Solar Energy Technologies**
          - **Photovoltaics (PV)**: Used in solar panels; captures energy directly from sunlight and stores it in PV cells.
          - **Concentrating Solar-Thermal Power (CSP)**: Used in large power plants; reflects sunlight with mirrors to create heat, which is then stored for energy.

        - **Turn Down Your Thermostat**
            - save as much as 3% energy consumtion per degree that you turn you thermostat down to during the winter season

      - Scary climate change statistics
        - [ 1 ] Within the next 2 decades, global temperatures are likely to reach 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels aka the "tipping point" of global warming, which will cause more forest fires, kill most coral reefs and cause irrepairable damage to the earth. https://www.earthday.org/5-terrifying-climate-change-facts-scare-halloween/

        - Food
            - The lower you eat on the food chain, the less impact that food has on the environment. Livestock is guilty of 14.5 percent of manmade global greenhouse gas emissions, mainly from feed production(food for livestock)
            - Reduce food waste by planning meal portions ahead of time and freezing left overs
            - Choose organic and local foods that are in season as transporting food long distances uses fossil fuels  
            - Compost your food if possible!
        - Clothing 
            - Don’t buy fast fashion. Trendy, cheap items that go out of style quickly get dumped in landfills where they produce methane as they decompose.
            - buy vintage or recycled clothing at consignment shops.
            - Wash your clothing in cold water. The enzymes in cold water detergent are designed to clean better in cold water. Doing two loads of laundry weekly in cold water instead of hot or warm water can save up to 500 pounds of carbon dioxide each year.
            - Currently, the average American discards about 80 pounds of clothing each year, 85 percent of which ends up in landfills.
        - Shopping
            - Buy less stuff! And buy used or recycled items whenever possible.
            - Bring your own reusable bag when you shop.
            - If you’re in the market for a new computer, opt for a laptop instead of a desktop. Laptops require less energy to charge and operate than desktops. 
        - Home
            - Do an energy audit of your home. This will help identify ways to be more energy efficient
            - Switch lights off when you leave the room and unplug your electronic devices when they are not in use.
            - Turn your water heater down to 120˚F. This can save about 550 pounds of CO2 a year.
        - Transportation
            - Drive less. Walk, take public transportation, carpool, rideshare or bike to your destination when possible.
            - If you must drive, avoid unnecessary braking and acceleration.
            - When doing errands, try to combine them to reduce your driving.
