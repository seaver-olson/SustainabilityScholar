            <h2>Biodiversity Basics</h2>
            <p>Biodiversity refers to the variety of life on Earth, including plants, animals, and microorganisms, as well as the ecosystems in which they live. It is a measure of the health of ecosystems and is essential for the survival of all living organisms, including humans. Biodiversity can be observed at different levels, including genetic diversity, species diversity, and ecosystem diversity.</p>
