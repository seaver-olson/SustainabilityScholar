        <h1>**Types of Solar Energy Technologies**</h1>
        <h2>Photovoltaic Solar Panels</h2>
        <p>Photovoltaic solar panels are the most common type of solar technology. They convert sunlight directly into electricity using semiconductors. These panels are typically installed on rooftops and can be used to power homes, businesses, and other buildings.</p>
        <h2>Solar Thermal Systems</h2>
        <p>Solar thermal systems use sunlight to heat water or air for use in homes, businesses, and industrial processes. These systems can be used for heating, cooling, and water heating, and are often more efficient than photovoltaic panels for these applications.</p>
